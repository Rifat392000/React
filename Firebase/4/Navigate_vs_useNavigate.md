# Difference Between `Navigate` and `useNavigate` in React Router DOM

Ah yes! `Navigate` and `useNavigate` in **React Router DOM** â€” they both handle navigation, but they work **very differently**.

Letâ€™s break it down:

---

### âœ… `Navigate` (Component)

```jsx
import { Navigate } from 'react-router-dom';

return <Navigate to="/login" />
```

#### ðŸ”¹ What it is:
- A **React component**
- Used to **redirect** users declaratively â€” like inside JSX

#### ðŸ”¹ Use case:
You want to conditionally redirect a user **based on some logic inside your render**, like:
```jsx
if (!user) {
  return <Navigate to="/login" />;
}
```

---

### âœ… `useNavigate` (Hook)

```jsx
import { useNavigate } from 'react-router-dom';

const navigate = useNavigate();
navigate('/login');
```

#### ðŸ”¹ What it is:
- A **hook**
- Used to **imperatively navigate** in response to an event â€” like a button click or after a function call.

#### ðŸ”¹ Use case:
You want to navigate somewhere after something happens, like:
```jsx
const handleSubmit = () => {
  // after login/signup logic
  navigate('/dashboard');
}
```

### ðŸ†š Quick Comparison:

| Feature        | `Navigate`                      | `useNavigate`                      |
|----------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Type           | Component (`<Navigate />`)       | Hook (`const navigate = useNavigate()`) |
| Use Style      | Declarative (JSX)                | Imperative (inside functions)       |
| Common Use     | Conditional redirects in render  | Navigation after events/actions     |
| Example        | `<Navigate to="/home" />`        | `navigate('/home')`                 |

### ðŸ”¥ TL;DR

- **Use `Navigate`** when you're inside JSX and need a redirect based on a condition.
- **Use `useNavigate`** when you're inside a function (like onClick or after an API call) and want to programmatically navigate.
