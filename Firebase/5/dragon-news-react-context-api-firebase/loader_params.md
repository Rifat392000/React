# Understanding `params` in React Router Loaders

In the provided code snippet, `params` is an object that contains the dynamic segments of the URL path. Let's break down how it works:

## Context: React Router Loaders

This code snippet appears to be using React Router's data loading feature, specifically the `loader` function. This function is executed before a route's component is rendered, and it's used to fetch data based on the route's parameters.

## Understanding `params`

### Route Definition:

* The route is defined as `/category/:id`.
* The colon (`:`) before `id` indicates that `id` is a dynamic segment or parameter in the URL.
* This means that the URL can have different values for `id`, such as `/category/01`, `/category/02`, etc.

### How `params` Captures the Dynamic Value:

* When a user navigates to a URL that matches this route (e.g., `/category/01`), React Router parses the URL.
* It identifies the dynamic segment (`01` in this case) and stores it in the `params` object.
* The `params` object becomes `{ id: '01' }`.

### Accessing the Parameter in the `loader` Function:

* The `loader` function receives the `params` object as an argument.
* Inside the `loader` function, you can access the value of the `id` parameter using `params.id`.
* In the provided snippet, `params.id` is used to construct the API URL:

    ```javascript
    `https://openapi.programming-hero.com/api/news/category/${params.id}`
    ```

* This dynamically generates the API URL based on the `id` from the URL.

### Example:

* If the user visits `/category/08`, then `params` will be `{ id: '08' }`.
* The `loader` function will then fetch data from `https://openapi.programming-hero.com/api/news/category/08`.

## In Summary:

* `params` is an object that holds the dynamic parts of a URL.
* The dynamic parts are defined in the route using a colon (`:`) followed by the parameter name (e.g., `:id`).
* React Router automatically extracts these dynamic values and stores them in the `params` object.
* The `loader` function, or any other function that receives `params` as an argument, can then use these values to perform dynamic operations, such as fetching data from an API.
